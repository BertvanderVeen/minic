# Minimization for ill-conditioned problems
## Regularized quasi-Newton optimisation
Currently the only function, `rnewt` implements general-purpose regularized quasi-Newton optimisation routines as presented in [Kanzow and Steck (2023)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12532-023-00238-4). The C++ code is written from scratch, and the More-Thuente linesearch script is an R-port specifically written for this implementation, but translated from [the python implementation associated to the article](https://github.com/dmsteck/paper-regularized-qn-benchmark/blob/d6777fa872bebcc38ebe2d7aa9dc21862d3b7ffd/utility/morethuente.py#L4).
